Kilonova is a (work-in-progress) platform for competitive programming.

## For other developers, which may want to contribute

I added `.gitignore`s for `run.sh`, which could host your scripts for compilation, execution, everything.

## STUFF TO DO

- For closed alpha:

	- Finish grader

	- Connect grader to DB

	- Design a user hierarchy

	- Add various extensions to the task description markup (like MathJax)

	- Add more functionality
