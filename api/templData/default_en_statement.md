# Task

You are given two integers $a$ and $b$. Compute the sum of those two integers.

# Input data

The first line will contain two numbers, $a$ and $b$.

# Output data

The first line will contain a single number, representing the sum of the two numbers.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq a, b \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000$;
* This is an example statement, change it however you like, but try to stick to the format. A guide will be published in the future with more information on statement formatting guidelines.

# Example 1

`{{.InputFile}}`
```
