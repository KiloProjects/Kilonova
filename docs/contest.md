Kilonova Contest Interface
==========================

Welcome to the Kilonova contest interface! Kilonova was designed to offer, aside from a comprehensive problem set, an opportunity for smaller contest organizers to host their creations.

Why?
====

Of course, anyone can use CodeForces' Polygon system, but it tends not to be the nicest platform. Kilonova was designed from the ground up for a simple, but powerful experience/

How?
====

First, talk to the site's owner for proposer rights (in the future, this restriction might be lifted).

After that, create a new contest by specifying:
- a name
- a short description

After the contest is created, you can create a new problem or use an existing problem. Newly-created problems will be automatically made visible once 

You can optionally specify a start/end date in the contest's settings. The contest can be manually toggled on and off if the start/end dates are not specified.

Historical Contest (?)
======================

I think it would be nice to offer "Historical Contests", an archived contest with no leaderboards.

Virtual Contest (?)
===================

A user can go on a contest (normal or historical) and create a "virtual contest", a contest available only to him.

Contest Features
================

- You can set a start and an end time for the contest;
- You can have a (public) leaderboard;
