# Contests

Contests are a functionality in which users "register" to partake in problem solving during a fixed interval of time.

## Contest flags

- Public join: anyone can register, regardless of contest visibility, before it starts
- Visible: the contest is visible on the main page
    - Please note that, while visibility affects the contest's presence and access on various pages, registered users are able to see the contest while it's running no matter what (they won't be able to see the contest before or after it's taken place).
