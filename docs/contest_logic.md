## Contest timeline

1. Contest is created and set up
    - Only the name is provided
    - Defaults to starting a week later and lasting 3 hours, but will most likely be changed
2. Pre-contest

## Notes

-   USACO and ICPC features do not properly work together, since ICPC scores are calculated using the contest's start time instead of the user start time.
